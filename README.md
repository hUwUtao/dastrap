# dastrap

test embedness of daScript.
however cannot unlock full potential of the dascript engine since we only able to embed
mostly nothing out of every libraries of dascript. although, most component should really be
based off rust-land ffi or whatever, it should also be interop-able from JVM or Node

the goal of project is to build a more portable executable environ that is encapsulated
as good as Java and portable like Lua. it is also pretty much inspired by Unity component system
because of its easiness to program with

(yet compile on Windows under debug
having some `__imp__CrtDbgReport` or whatever it is,
on Linux should be normal)
